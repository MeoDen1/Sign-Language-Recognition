# Sign Language using Transformer

A Research Project on creating a python application that are able to predict the gloss (text) and generate sequence from Sign Language. 

Currently, the application utilizes MediaPipe for holistic landmark extraction and Transformer-based model to predict the gloss. <br>
The dataset for classification is Kaggle competition public dataset: [Google Isolated Sign Lanugage Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asl-signs)

Details of implementation and model training are documented in **build.ipynb**
